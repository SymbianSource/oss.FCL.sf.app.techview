# Description:
# //    route.ini - a configuration file for ipadm
# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FILE
# This file should be located in C:\Data\IpAdm\route.ini.
# This file is processed by IpAdm when you push the
# Add Routes -button.
# Each line starting with route-add followed by positional
# parameters is directly used as a KSoInetAddRoute parameter:
# route-add <dest> <netmask> <metric> <gateway> [interface]
# If optional parameter interface is omitted, gateway address
# determines the interface. With this command you can add static
# routes into the routing table.
# Some 6to4 route examples
# route-add 2001:: ffff:: 1 2002:c171:3a50::c171:3a50
# route-add 3ffe:: ffff:: 1 2002:c171:3a50::c171:3a50
# route-add 2001:: ffff:: 1 2002:836b:4179::836b:4179
# route-add 3ffe:: ffff:: 1 2002:836b:4179::836b:4179
# Some other examples
# route-add 172.21.40.1 255.255.254.0 1 - 172.21.40.106
# route-add 3ffe:501:fffff:ff05:: ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:: 1 3ffe:501:ffff:ff03:200:ff:fe00:a0a0 fe80::260:63ff:fe01:d6a9
# To add a default route, use zero address and prefix
# route-add :: :: 1 3ffe:501:ffff:ff03:200:ff:fe00:a0a0 fe80::260:63ff:fe01:d6a9
# route-add 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 1 172.21.40.1 182.21.40.106
# Similarly you can configure interfaces with ifconfig
# ifconfig <if> <prefix> prefix <prefixlen> ["alias"] ["up"/"down"] ["delete"]
# ifconfig ethernet 10.0.5.3 alias
# ifconfig ethernet 3ffe:501:ffff:100:: prefix 64 alias
# ifconfig ethernet fe80::200:ff:f00:a0a0 prefix 64 delete
# ifconfig ethernet fe80::260:63ff:fe01:d6a9 prefix 64 up
# If you want to initiate DAD on the fly you need to remove
# all addresses of specific interface identifier from an interface
# and then define a new interface identifier to be checked by DAD:
# ifconfig ethernet 3ffe:501:ffff:100:200:ff:fe00:a0a0 prefix 64 delete
# ifconfig ethernet fe80::200:ff:fe00:a0a0 prefix 64 delete
# ifconfig ethernet fe80::260:63ff:fe01:d6a9 prefix 64 delete
# ifconfig ethernet fe80::260:63ff:fe01:d6a9 prefix 64 up
# The above method is handy for example when running the TAHI
# stateless address autoconfiguration tests requiring frequently
# all addresses to be removed and DAD to be performed for link-local
# address. With EPOC you don't need to reboot, just have appropriate
# settings in route.ini and push the Add Routes button in IpAdm.
